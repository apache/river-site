Portions of this software were developed by Bill Venners of Artima, Inc., who
led the ServiceUI project. The ServiceUI project, which was hosted at jini.org,
was tasked with defining a "standard" approach to attaching UIs to Jini services.
The ServiceUI specification and API represent the best amalgamation of the ideas
contributed by all the people who participated in the serviceui project. 

The original two releases of the ServiceUI API, including specifications
and code, are available from:
