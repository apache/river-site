  A recent <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/river-dev/201802.mbox/%3cCAEdUjjj+OCs_Q5sLaSQmBEJsKKF-En0432YWoTcN4PzppmTMiw@mail.gmail.com%3e">initiative</a>
  aims at revising JINI specifications:

  "The idea is to prioritize the modernization of the River
  specification into a set of language and transport agnostic architectural
  principles. River currently supports architectural concepts like discovery,
  events, proxies and more! In reality, both the implementation language and
  communication transport are minor details."
