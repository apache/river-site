## Web site

If you find something on our pages that needs to be corrected, would like to add new information or do other changes,
here are some details to start with.

 - River's site relies on Apache CMS system. Find generic information about [how to manage a project website](https://www.apache.org/dev/project-site.html)
 - River CMS is listed among [Apache CMS projects](https://cms.apache.org/#bookmark). This is the starting point for
the web based editor.
 - The CMS is based on [markdown and additions](https://www.apache.org/dev/cmsref#markdown) for creating content.
 - Our pages also make use of Bootstrap framework and ['Spacelab' theme](https://bootswatch.com/spacelab/) for it.
If your are new to the framework see this nice introductory [material](http://www.w3schools.com/Bootstrap/default.asp).
 - Some more elements are added by using [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/).


<div class="alert alert-info">
Please note that combining markdown and html/Boostrap may sometimes result in unexpected look of a page. Moreover
certain Font Awesome icons do not show up.
