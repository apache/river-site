#The Future Direction of River

There is currently a discussion on the dev mailing list which touches on the future of River.  In particular if the focus of River should be geared towards direct support of "application" developers, support of developers writing "down stream" projects or both.

The discussion can be found in the [mail archive](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/river-dev/201012.mbox/%3cAANLkTi=+GrFS0-EJe+UBtkScU8JFYdpvo1EmoPOK2+6z@mail.gmail.com%3e).

This is currently unresolved.
