## Relevant issues

### Trust
Centralized vs one to one trust relationships. Using TLS to establish trust.

### Code deployment
Deploy code at runtime: only download from trusted source, not from anonymous http codebase server.

Deploy code at application deployment moment: included in application download (from appstore for instance)

### NAT / Firewall issues
Internet based proxies vs NAT traversal

### Discovery
Using existing reggie or new standard mechanisms like DNS-SD.
